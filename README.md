# advent of code 2022

## python

python solutions are kept in [py/](./py/)

these are generally the smaller, more straight-forward solutions that i start
with each day.

run them from the root of the project like so:

```bash
$ python py/day2.py
```

## rust

rust solutions are kept in [rs/](./rs/)

i usually write these after solving the puzzles in python. these
implementations are more focused on modularity or interesting rust features
than just solving the given problem.

run them with cargo from the [rs/](./rs/) directory like so:

```bash
$ cargo run --bin day2
```
